It names the new mechanism AMetric. \r\nSome should be noted that:\r\n\r\n- these generic metrics typically refer to network metrics as described in Section 2 of draft-ietf-lsr-flex-algo-bw-con-15:\r\n\"The Traffic Engineering Default Metric is defined in [RFC5305] and [RFC3630] and the Min Unidirectional delay metric is defined in [RFC8570] and [RFC7471]. Other metrics, such as jitter, reliability, and fiscal cost may be helpful, depending on the traffic class.\"\r\n\r\n- These two drafts are more on metric exposure and metric distribution rather than the definition of new metrics.\r\n- As mentioned in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-generic-metric/ , it keeps emphasizing accumulation which should be compared with aggregation that mentioned in our drafts. \r\n- Similarly, it has a definition on normalized bit(Section 5) and which component does normalization(Section 8), and the way to use this normalized value(Section 8 and 9). I think we should refer to this part when we consider to define our normalized CATS metrics.\r\n- As Cheng mentioned above and also Lindar mentioned in the list, there are some other documents describing CATS related metrics and ways to exposure. We should also look into these docs and put them into the same discussion thread.    ",

If not, will there be a simple derivation and generation of another value(L3 metric)?. I'm not recommending we should have a L3 abstraction, but try to understand such case.
